# MyPeerServer

An implementation of WebRTC in JavaScript using node as the communication server. Written after attending my first Kiwicon and hearin from one of the developers of B33f.
Nothing hacking here just intersted in STUN and ICE. Still interested in how it could be used by an attacker, believe the only example is mapping the network.
